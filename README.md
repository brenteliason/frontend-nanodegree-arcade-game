## Instructions

The arcade game (based on Frogger) is ready to play as soon as the page is loaded. Use the arrow keys to navigate the game. Every time you reach the water, you win and the game automatically restarts. Every time you collide with a bug, you lose and the game automatically restarts.

To start the game open index.html

You can relaunch the game entirely (resetting wins and losses back to 0) by refreshing the page (index.html).

## Contributing

This respository is for my version of the Arcade Game for my third project in Udacity's Front-End Developed Nanodegree program, so I will most likely not accept pull requests.

For details on contributing to Udacity's original project (i.e. the starter code), check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
